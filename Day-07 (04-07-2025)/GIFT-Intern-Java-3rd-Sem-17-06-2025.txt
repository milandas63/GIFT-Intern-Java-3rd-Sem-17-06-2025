    =   What is OOPs?
        OOPs stands for Object Oriented Programming. It is a paradigm for writing programs.
        It is a way of writing the programmes. There are several ways of writing programs:
            1.  Procedure Oriented Programming
            2.  Objected Oriented Programming

    =   The OOPs paradigms are:
        1.  Encapsulation
            When the data and the code are kept together in one class wrapper, it is 
            encapsulation.
            Encapsulation has another concept for data hiding called Abstraction.

        2.  Inheritance
            A class where the program is written is inherited by another class. The
            inheritance are of 2 types:
                1.  Multiple inheritance

                    Animal              Aqua        Land   Botanical
                      |                  |            |      |

                                |                            |
                            Parent-1                     Parent-2
                                 |                           |
                                 +--------+------------------+

                                        my-class

                    ** Java doesn't support multiple inheritance. Java supports single
                       inheritance

                2.  Multilevel inheritance

                    Java supports multilevel inheritance

                      E
                      +- D
                      |  +- B
                      |  |  +- A

                    The ADAM class in Java is Object class. Class Object is the root 
                    of the class hierarchy

        3.  Polymorphism
            A technique to give same name to several units. Different methods/functions
            having same name.
            Polymorphism are of 2 types:
                1.  Overloading
                    When 2 method members have same name within a single class, it is
                    know as overloading

                    class Work {
                        void create() {
                        }

                        void create(int i) {
                        }

                        void create(String s) {
                        }

                        void create(String s, int a) {
                        }

                        void create(String s, int a) {      // Compilation Error
                        }                                   // Similar method is already defined
                    }

                2.  Overriding
                    
                    class Sun {
                        void distance() {
                        }
                    }

                    class Earth extends Sun {
                        void distance() {
                        }
                    }

                Inheritance is explained using the following:

                    1.  Parent      Child
                    2.  Base        Derived
                    3.  Super       Sub

    =   What is the hierarchy of Java classes:

        jar-file

    =   Nomenclatures to define the syntax of a Java statement:
        []      -   Optional entry
        ()      -   Compulsory entry
        {}      -   Any of the of the following
        <>      -   User defined name
        |       -   Choice separator

    =   What is the syntax of a class?
            [access-modifiers]
            [modifiers]
            class <name-of-class>
            [extends <parent-class-name>]
            [implements <interface-name-list...>]
            {}

            [access-modifiers][modifiers] class <name-of-class> [extends <parent-class-name>] [implements <interface-name-list...>] {
                //  Field member (variable/data members)
                //  Constructor member
                //  Method member (functions)

                //  Inner-classes
            }

    =   How can one class access another class?
        There are 2 ways to access a class:
            1.  By inheritance
            2.  By creating an object

    =   [access-modifier]:
        Access modifiers are also known as access-specifiers. These keywords provide 
        special access to the class.
        There are 3 keywords used to specify the access:
            1.  public
                When public is defined to a class, the same class is accessible to
                all other classes in the same package and all other packages.
            2.  protected
            3.  private
            4.  <undefined>

    =   The Java programming language comes in 3 flavors:
        1.  Java2SE (Java 2 Standard Edition)
        2.  Java2EE (Java 2 Enterprise Edition)
        3.  Java2ME (Java 2 Micro Edition)

    =   What are the features of a computer programming language?
        1.  The program is written in sequence of line number
        2.  It can jump/branch from one line to another line
        3.  Ability to compute
        4.  Ability to loop across a set of lines
        5.  Ability to check condition

    =   How many types of programming languages are there?
        There are 3 types of programming languages:
        1.  Passive language
            Those languages that don't adhere the normal features of a computer programming language.
            These languages are created for presentation purpose. Example of such languages are:
            >   HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language)
            >   SGML (Simple Generalized Markup Language)

        2.  Active language
            Computer programming was created to work like active languages. Active languages are
            problem solvers. It can solve mission critical problems. They are executed in the machine
            in which it resides. They use the resources of the resident machine.
            Example:
                C, C++, Java, Python, etc
            
        3.  Dynamic language
            Those languages that are resident in the server machine. On receiving request to execute,
            it is executed in the server machine using the server resources and only the output of the
            program in form of passive language is transmitted to the requesting machine.
            Example:
            >   JSP (Java Server Pages)
            >   ASP (Active Server Pages)
            >   PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor)

    =   Java programmes are of 3 types:
        1.  Application
            Starts from main() method
        2.  Applet
            
        3.  Servlet

    =   What are the way a class can access another class.
        There are 2 ways how one class may access another class.
        1.  By Inheritance
                Example:
                    package: com.milkyway
                                Star
                                Planet
                    package: com.ameraganda
                                Light
                                Gas
                The Planet class want to use Star class. 
                This is access by a class in the same package.
                    1.  class Planet extends Star {}
                This is access by a class from a different package.
                    2.  class Light extends Plant {}
        
        2.  By Object reference
                2.  Star st = new Star();
                    st.methods();

    =   What are the content of a class?
        The class contains basically 3 things:
            class Example {
                // Field members
                String name;
                int age;
                double height;

                // Construct members
                public Example() {
                }
                public Example(String name, int age, double height) {
                }
                
                // Method members
                public void Example() {
                }
                public String getName() {
                }
            }

    =   [access-modifier]:
        Access modifiers are also known as access-specifiers. These keywords provide 
        special access to the class.
        There are 3 keywords used to specify the access:
            1.  public
                When public is defined to a class, the same class is accessible to
                all other classes in the same package and to other classes from different packages
                both by inheritance and by object reference.
            2.  protected
                When protected is defined to a class, the same class is accessible to other classes
                by both inheritance and object reference from the same package. But from other packages,
                inheritance is restricted.
            3.  private
                Access is restricted.
            4.  <undefined>
                Undefined classes may be accessed by other classes in the same package by inheritance
                and by object reference. But when it is accessed from a different package, inheritance
                is allowed and object reference is restricted.

    =   [modifiers]:
        There are 8 modifiers:

    =   Exception Handling
        >   What is Exception Handling?
            Exception handling is a fault resistance technique in Java Programming language.
        
        >   The try statement is used for handling exceptions. The try statement has another
            2 more clauses. The clauses are catch and finally. If you are writing a java program
            with try statement, the catch or finally must exist.

            Example:
                    try {
                        ...........
                        ...........
                        ...........
                        ...........
                    } catch(ExceptionName1 e) {
                        ..........
                        ..........

                    } catch(ExceptionName2 e) {
                        ..........
                        ..........

                    } catch(ExceptionName3 e) {
                        ..........
                        ..........

                    } catch(ExceptionName4 e) {
                        ..........
                        ..........

                    } finally {
                        ..........

    =   How many types of exception classes are there?
        There are 2 types of exception classes.
        1)  Checked Exception
            When the compiler check the existance of an exception.
        2)  Unchecked Exception
            Those exceptions that are not check during compilation.
            A unchecked exception inherits the RuntimeException.
